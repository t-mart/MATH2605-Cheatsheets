These are/were my cheatsheets for Georgia Tech Spring 2012 MATH2605, taught by
Zhiwu Lin.

There is an 2 exams throughout the semester and 1 final.

HUGE DISCLAIMER: Do not rely on these cheatsheets to be accurate! They only
reflect _my_ understanding of the concepts, and I'm certainly not acing this
class. User beware.
